Hi!!
I am Mehmet Gökhan Gökçe, a data analyst with a background in Computer Engineering. I am familiar with mathematics, statistics, and programming languages, which are the foundation of data science. Thanks to the specialized training I received, I had the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice, giving me confidence in analyzing complex datasets, deriving meaningful insights, and developing data-driven solutions.

My skills include programming languages such as Python, C/C++, and SQL, data processing with tools like Pandas, Numpy, and MS Excel, and data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, and MS Excel. I am also experienced in data management with SQL and have expertise in hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Robotics, 3D Printers, and Basic Electronics.
